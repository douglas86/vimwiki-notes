= Adding base templates to forms =
	* the only thing that you are doing is removing hardcoded urls
	* this is in the base.html file, where the navbar normally sits

== base.html ==
	<a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'food:create_items' %}" style="color: #f59342;"
		>Add Item <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a
