What is the purpose of an app_name?
	* It allows you to reverse URL's if multiple instance of an app is deployed
	* In other words considering that multiple apps will share the same URL's, 
		it makes it easier to tell the apps appart

How do you use app_name?
	* edit the food/urls.py file:
		* food - this is the name of the app
		* urls.py - this is the file inside of the food app, that was created

			from . import views
			from django.urls import path

			app_name = "food"
			urlpatterns = [
    			path("", views.index, name="index"),
			]
