1. Before creating a db make sure that you have created a Schema first:
	* A Schema is a blueprint, on how to store data in your bd
2. To create a schema have a look at new_models link
	* [[2020-09-03cre|new models]]
	* 2020-09-03cre
3. Entering data into the db using the shell commands:
	1. $ python manage.py shell
		* python - this is used to tell the terminal that you are running a python script
		* manage.py - this is the script that is being run
		* shell - telling the script that you want to start the python shell
	2. Once in the shell run the following:
		1. from food.models import Item
			* this is importing Item from the food.models file
		2. Item.objects.all()
			* this is printing all the items stored in the object Item
		3. <QuerySet []>
			* this is printed out when the above command is run
			* the square brackets are empty, because there is nothing in the database
		4. a = Item(item_name="Pizza",item_desc="Cheesy Pizza",item_price=20)
			* a - this is the variable to be called when needed
			* Item - this is the object that was declared in the models.py file
			* all of the information in the round brackets says what is going into the db
		5. a.save()
			* command used to save to the db
		6. Item.objects.all()
			* this is printing all the items stored in the object Item
		7. <QuerySet [<Item: Item object (1)>]>
			* this is printed out when the above command is run
			* the information that is between the square brackets is the item that was just saved
			* Item object (1) - this is variable a that was saved
		8. a.id
			* this returns the id of the variable a in the db
		9. a.pk
			* this is used to return the primary key of object a
		10. b = Item(item_name="Burger",item_desc="Cheesy Burger",item_price=10)
			* b - this is the variable to be called when needed
			* Item - this is the object that was declared in the models.py file
			* all of the information in the round brackets says what is going into the db
		11. b.save()
			* command used to save to the db
		12. b.id
			* this returns the id of the variable b in the db
		13. b.pk
			* this is used to return the primary key of the object b
		14. Item.objects.all()
			* this is printing all the items stroed in the object Item
		15. <QuerySet [<Item: Item object (1)>, <Item: Item object (2)>]>
			* this is printed out when the above command is run
			* the information that is between the square brackets are the items that are stored in the db
			* Item object (1) - this is object a
			* Item object (2) - this is object b
		16. 
	3. If you want the item name instead of the Item object then type the following:
		this gets place inside of the class Item in the models.py file	
			def __str__(self):
        		return self.item_name
	4. then stop the power shell
		* exit()
	5. restart the power  shell for it to take effect
		* python manage.py shell
	6. run the following commands again:
		1. from food.models import Item
			* this is used to import Item from the models.py file
		2. Item.objects.all()
			* this prints out everything that is stored in the db
		3. <QuerySet [<Item: Pizza>, <Item: Burger>]>
			* instead of seeing Item object you will see the name of the item
			* Pizza - being the name of the item
