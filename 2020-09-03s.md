= In the first terminal =
1. Set up a virtual environment for your project
	* [[../../../python/virtual_env|setting up a new virtual environment]]
	* 2020-09-03se
2. Activate your newly created project
3. Then run the following commands:
	1. $ pip install Django==2.2.1 django-livesync
		* pip - python package manager
		* install - command to tell pip that you want to install something
		* Django==2.2.1 - installing the Django package version 2.2.1
		* django-livesync - this is to restart server on file change
	2. $ pip freeze
		* run this to see if the package is installed
	3. $ django-admin startproject mysite
		* django-admin - command to tell the terminal that you want to run the django-admin command
		* startproject - tells Django that you want to start a new command
		* mysite - this is the name of the new project to be started
	4. $ ls
		* ls - to list all files and folders in current directory
	5. $ cd mysite
		* cd - change directory to newly created directory
	6. $ vim
		* text editor to edit the files and folders

= In the second terminal =
1. this terminal i use to keep the server up and running
2. activate the virtual environment
3. cd into mysite
4. run the following commands:
	1. $ python manage.py runserver
		* python - command used to run a script
		* manage.py - name of the script that you are wanting to run
		* runserver - passing an argument to the script to say that you are want to run the server
			You can also put a port number after runserver to tell it to use a different port
			such as 8001 it uses 8000 by default

			If you get this message when you run the server:
			You have 17 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you 
 				apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
			Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

	2. then stop the server and run the following commands:
		1. $ python manage.py migrate
			* migrate - this is to migrate the changes into the database
5. The next step would be to install and set up django-livesync
	* [[../../python_packages/django-livesync|django-livesync]] - This app is used to restart server on file change
6. Installing django-livereload to restart google chrome everytime the server restarts
	* [[../../python_packages/django-livereload-server]]
7. Once that is done:
	* copy the link for the server
	* paste that link in a web browser, I prefer google chrome.
	* hit enter, that should display the newly created Django web site
