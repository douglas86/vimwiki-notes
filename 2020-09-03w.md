= What is the csrf_token =
The CSRF token only ensures that only forms that have originated from trusted domains 
can be used to POST data back. So it doesn't validate the data or how much data the form sends 
but if data comes from a form from a legit domain (your site usually). 
Hence the name: Cross Site Request Forgery protection
