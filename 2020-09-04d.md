	app_name = "food"
	urlpatterns = [
		# home
		path("", views.index, name="index"),
		#  item
		path("item/", views.item, name="item"),
		# /item_id number
		path("<int:item_id>/", views.detail, name="detail"),
		#  add items
		path("add/", views.create_items, name="create_items"),
		#  edit
		path("update/<int:item_id>/", views.update_item, name="update_item"),
		#  delete
