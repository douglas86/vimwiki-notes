= Adding additional fields to users =
	* Create a new file called forms.py inside of the users app
	* Once that is done you can go and change the views.py file to inherite from the RegisterForm class
	* 

== forms.py ==

	from django import forms
	from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm

	class RegisterForm(UserCreationForm):
		email = forms.EmailField()

		class Meta:
			model = User
			fields = ['username', 'email', 'password1', 'password2']
			
	* Line 9:11, You are inheriting from the in-built django classes or functions
	* Line 14, This is the new field to be created
	* Line 16, This is a Meta class, a meta class just provides info on the specific class being used
	* Line 17, this is the model, this is where django will store your data in the db
	* Line 18, these are the fields that you want in your field

== views.ppy ==

	from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
	from django.contrib import messages
	from .forms import RegisterForm

	# Create your views here.
	def register(request):
		"""TODO: Docstring for register.

		:request: TODO
		:returns: TODO

		"""
		if request.method == 'POST':
			form = RegisterForm(request.POST)
			if form.is_valid():
				form.save()
				username = form.cleaned_data.get("username")
				messages.success(request, f'Welcome {username}, your account is created')
				return redirect("food:index")
		else:
			form = RegisterForm()

		return render(request, 'user/register.html', {'form':form})
