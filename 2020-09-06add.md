= Adding get absolute method =
* go into the models.py file of the food app
* the reason for adding this method
* is for when somebody adds a new item
* they will be redirected to the details page

== models.py ==

	from django.db import models
	from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	from django.urls import reverse

	# Create your models here.
	class Item(models.Model):
		user_name = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=1)

			return self.item_name

		def get_absolute_url(self):
			return reverse("food:detail", kwargs={"pk":self.pk})
			
	* Line 12, import the reverse function to use the method that you need
	* Line 28, create a new method called get_absolute_url
	* Line 29, using the reverse method as soon as an item is added you get redirected to the details page 
	  			food:detail - this is a template that is being used
							food - this is the name of the app
							detail - this is the name that you have declared in the url patterns
				pk - this is the primary key that is passed to the method
