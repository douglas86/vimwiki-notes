= Uploading an app to Heroku =
* First make sure that you have heroku installed, if not see this link
* [[2020-09-07d|Downloading and installing Heroku CLI]]
* then go ahead and login to heroku, this will then open up a web browser
* $ heroku login
* then create a Procfile in the projects route directory
* which for me it is the directory where manage.py is stored
* $ touch Procfile
* then open the Procfile and add the line below
* web: gunicorn food_app2.wsgi --log-file -
* change food_app2 to whatever the name of your app is
* create a runtime.txt file to say what version of python you are using
* $ touch runtime.txt
* then install the following packages
* pip install gunicorn dj-database-url whitenoise psycopg2
* pip install gunicorn
* next create a requirements.txt file
* this command will place all installed packages into the requirements.txt file
* $ pip freeze > requirements.txt


* pip install social-auth-app-django~=3.1 python-jose~=3.0 python-dotenv~=0.9
