= Adding image fields to api's =
* in order to work with images you need to install pillow
* $ pip install pillow
* define an image model in models.py
* once that is done then define a new serializer in serializer.py
* go into the base directory, and create a new directory called media
* base directory is in the same folder as manage.py
* then go into mysite/settings.py file, and you need to define a new variable
* called MEDIA_ROOT at the bottom of that file
* then define another variable called MEDIA_URL
* there is one more thing that you need to do
* and that is to define the static path for the url in urls.py
