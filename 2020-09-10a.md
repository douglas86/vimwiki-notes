= Adding pagination =
	* go into the views.py file for that page
	* then import Paginator
	* once that is done go the the templates file
	* in my case the templates files is called index.html

== views.py ==

	from django.shortcuts import render
	from .models import MovieModel
	from django.core.paginator import Paginator

	# Create your views here.
	def movieViews(request):
		movie = MovieModel.objects.all()
		paginator = Paginator(movie,4)
		page = request.GET.get('page')
		movie = paginator.get_page(page)
		return render(request, 'newapp/index.html',{'movie':movie})
		
	* Line 12, import Paginator
	* Line 16, getting all the objects for the database
	* Line 17, create a varaible called paginator, then include the function that was imported 
	  movie - this is the object that was created from line 12
	  4 - this is the amount of items per page 
	* Line 18, this variable will get how many pages
	* Line 19, you can actually call this variable what ever you want to 
	  this method will get the number of pages from paginator
	* Line 20, return the context to the template
		
== index.html ==

	{% for move in movie %}
	<h1>{{ move }}</h1>
	{% endfor %}

	{% if movie.has_previous %}
	<a href="?page=1">First</a>
	<a href="?page={{ movie.previous_page_number }}">Previous</a>
	{% endif %}

	Page: {{ movie.number }} of {{ movie.paginator.num_pages }}

	{% if movie.has_next %}
	<a href="?page={{ movie.next_page_number }}">Next</a>
	<a href="?page={{ movie.num_pages }}">Last</a>
	{% endif %}
	
	* Line 38, takes the movie object and runs a check to see if it has a previous page
	* Line 39, if you click on First page it will direct you to the first page
	* Line 40, this will direct you to the previous page that you were on
	* Line 43, this will run a check to see home many pages there are 
	  movie.number - this will see what page number you are on
	  movie.paginator.num_pages - this will see how many pages there are
	* Line 45, takes the movie object and runs a check to see if it has a next page
	* Line 46, directs you to the next page
	* Line 47, directs you to the last page
