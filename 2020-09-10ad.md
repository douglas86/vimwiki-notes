	from .models import MovieModel
	from django.core.paginator import Paginator

	# Create your views here.
	def movieViews(request):
		movie = MovieModel.objects.all()

		movie_name = request.GET.get('movie_name')

		if movie_name != '' and movie_name is not None:
			movie = movie.filter(name__icontains=movie_name)

		paginator = Paginator(movie,4)
		page = request.GET.get('page')
		movie = paginator.get_page(page)
		return render(request, 'newapp/index.html',{'movie':movie})
		
	* Line 16, add a new variable called movie_name 
	  using a get request to get the input field with the name attribute
	* Line 18, if statement to check if the line is blank or None
	* Line 19, variable to filter the name that you are looking for 
	  name__icontains - this method is used for not making a strict search, 
	  					it will search for all letters containing, not exact matches

	<form action="" method="get" accept-charset="utf-8">
		<input type="search" name="movie_name" id="" value="">
		<button type="submit">Search</button>
