= coc-scssmodules =
coc.nvim extension for autocompletion and go-to-definition functionality for CSS Modules.

Note: If you have coc-tsserver installed, the go-to-defininition might show a popup instead linking to type definition for *.module.s?css instead. You'll just need to select the .css file for this case since I don't know how to fix it.
