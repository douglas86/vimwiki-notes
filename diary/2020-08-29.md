== Daily checklist ==

* [ ] Check what tasks todo

== ToDo ==
    1. having problems with closing hidden buffers in vim
	2. closing the preview of a function in vim
	3. vim is giving me unneccessary popups when cursor is on function
	4. create a spell checker for md files in vim or see what plugins are available for vim md files
	5. 

== Notes ==
    * installed a plugin called close-buffers.vim
	* then wrote a timer function inside of my vimrc to close all hidden buffers every 5 seconds
	* running an autocmd to close function previews
	* struggling to close pop-ups when in normal mode, it turns out that it could be a balloon_eval feature
